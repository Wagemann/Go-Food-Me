Decided to go forth with a FARM stack approach. Researching FastAPI, React, and MongoDB.
8/23/2022
FastAPI is working. Backend complete. Finally got the logo to show up on homepage
8/24/2022
Added post and payment models, still trying to get the optional fields up and running
8/25/2022
Figured out the null value issue, getting the optional fields to work for payments, bootstrap added to index
8/26/2022
Day Off!

8/29/2022
Day spent searching for answers with no luck. We picked the FARM stack to learn more, but I can't say I'm really learning much. It's a huge confusing mess, I feel like I'm not able to contribute, all of what I thought I knew doesn't work here.

8/30/2022
I think things went well on the accounts side of things, still trying to figure out post. Trying my best to loop up solutions but everything I'm getting is already stuff they've already tried, so I don't know how to contribute during these tough times when I understand the least and don't want to be a burden.

8/31/2022
helped to update the post backend to reflect how they fixed things on the accounts side of things. we finally got the backend to be totally complete and working correctly. we're now on the way to front end and react.

9/01/2022
we divvied up which front end react pages to work on. decided to work on the list post page, post detail pages. things are moving smoothly as this feels way more familiar.

9/02/2022
List page works. Made it simple with a plain table. Next step is getting them to card form to look better.

9/03/2022
Figured out how to get things in card form. Moving onto details page.

9/05/2022
Labor day!

9/06/2022
spent most of the day researching css and react

9/07/2022
Tried some stuff with CSS and failed. This is something I need to brush up on as I can't remember a thing about it.

9/08/2022
got all the individual cards to link to the detail page on click rather than button. trying to figure out how to get the delete function to work

9/09/2022
finally got the list page to show the cards in rows of 3 columns that fill the spaces on their own evenly spaced.

9/12/2022
fixing issues from merging, had trouble remembering to switch to my branch from main

9/13/2022
Going back to old CSS info for refresher as I can't recall how to do any of that.
List page cards now properly showing cards in grid display. Made each card link to their respective update pages on click, rather than buttons.

9/14/2022
Got update page to update, delete to delete, but can't figure out how to have the created input form in the update to not require input. It doesn't make sense to keep updating the date that it was created, but we can't figure out how to make it optional.

9/15/2022
spent the whole day trying to pre-fill the update page input forms with the previous data so that you don't need to re-type the whole thing, and can instead just edit. Got the data to show, but it wouldn't allow any changes. Tried to style the css to be more in line with source material, but couldn't figure it out. I ended up giving up on everything, reverting back to how they were, and added a redirect to previous screen on update. that's it.

9/16/2022
can't figure out testing. it's down the wire and our inexperience with using both FastAPI, and MongoDB is biting us in the rear. The tests that we've been trying from Learn, to ones Andrew gave us, to various google sources all seem to be doing things differently. I don't understand it fully, but something about how we're not using classes, but instead are using functions for everything, make it different. It keeps overriding our empty settings and going back into the database.

after 3+ hours, they finally figured out the testing. I think we're done.
