Today the group came together for the first time we did quick introductions and got into ideas for the project, 
I had talked to Gordon early about my ideas when we group on another pair assignment the first idea was an anime 
recommendation site similar to a music recommendation site we had seen at the end of the last module. That was 
turned down as not everyone was interested in anime but my second idea was a charity food app based off Go Fund Me.
This seemed to be a big hit and we hit the ground running from there just discussing our vision of what the app could 
look like, all sorts of functionality it could have.
