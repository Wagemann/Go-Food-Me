Today the group came together for the first time we did quick introductions and got into ideas for the project, I had talked to Gordon early about my ideas when we group on another pair assignment the first idea was an anime recommendation site similar to a music recommendation site we had seen at the end of the last module. That was turned down as not everyone was interested in anime but my second idea was a charity food app based off Go Fund Me.
This seemed to be a big hit and we hit the ground running from there just discussing our vision of what the app could look like, all sorts of functionality it could have.

We worked together on creating and Excalidraw of page design, models needed, and talked about what kind of api we would need to search for to create the shopping list and enable delivery, we were going to use amazon list and see if we could limit it to food items. 

## Wednesday August 17, 2022

We discussed how we were going to handle user creation and looked into other apis we could possible use besides amazon which is when we found that Instacart api might be more suited for this application. We will have to research this more before we make final decisions but project design is going well.

We worked more on the excalidraw for the project and discussed that we believe that using the instacart api would be the more viable route then Amazon. Still need to investigate more into the API as it is the more difficult part of the project but the rest seems like it will be more straightforward. Till we begin working on a long list of stretch goals we have.

We began shrinking down our ideas into a MVP, came up with base models for the backend to work on and decided that technologies we wanted to use for the project. We all decided that we wanted to try to implement FastAPI as we are all unfamiliar with it but believe that it will be put to good use for our site as well as provide a good challenge to us. Had a friend of mine make up a quick fun logo for our project he sent to me and the group seemed to like it. Will all be working on understanding the framework more this weekend and over the coming week. We ended the night with getting the Docker Compose file written for the project up and running so we can start with a fresh working project next week.

We shrank our MVP down one further step to basically be a more straightforward Go fund me clone with the first stretch goal being adding the shopping list. We also after talking with Andrew discussed switching out database to MongoDB as it might be better suited for our project and based on research online, there is a tried and proven tech stack known as the FARM stack with plenty of information available. We decided to spend the day focusing on researching the integration of all these technologies together so we have a more clear outlook on how we are going to move forward with the project. Worked on wire frames for the Homepage, how it works page, fundraiser list and detail page. Before the night ended switched the docker compose file from postgres database to Mongodb. Ended the night with working skeleton to build off from.
