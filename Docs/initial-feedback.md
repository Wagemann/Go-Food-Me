## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
I think this is a really cool idea and for a good cause. There are plenty of directions that you could take it, so you're not going to run out work to do.

### Scope of work
The MVP functionality that you have outlined seems pretty reasonable but I have ~~two~~ one question~~s~~:
- bullet #3 under Stretch Goals says that it is for V1, so should it be on your MVP list?
- I see that "find local stores" is not in the MVP, but that you have Amazon (see above) to cover that, so double down on question above â¤´.

### Docs
The start on your docs looks good. For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your `integrations.md` file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.
