# Integrations

The application will need to get the following kinds of
data from third-party sources:


* Food Shopping List
* Locations
* Delivery Information

These are the 3rd party APIs

* Instacart Fullfillment API - https://docs.instacart.com/connect/api/fulfillment/overview
    * This API deals with finding nearby store locations, linking account info and orders to insta cart, and making, updating, and cancelling orders.
* Kroger Products - https://developer.kroger.com/reference
    * This API will deal with giving us a list of products, it will also deal with the search aspect of products
