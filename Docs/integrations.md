# Integrations

The application will need to get the following kinds of
data from third-party sources:

* Instacart Fullfillment API - https://docs.instacart.com/connect/api/fulfillment/overview
    * This API deals with finding nearby store locations, linking account info and orders to insta cart, and making, updating, and cancelling orders.
* Kroger Location and Product API - https://developer.kroger.com/reference
    * This will allow us to find locations near the consumer that are in need of food as well as list and search for the products.
